# learn-golang

My personal repo as I learn about `golang` along. 

## Installation

`.devcontainer` is included to host development environment in a Docker container and be used by `vscode`. See <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers> for more details

## go tools

`vscode` extention for Go would require installing several Go tools, which can be done automatically by running [Go: Install/Update Tools](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/blob/master/docs/commands.md#go-installupdate-tools) command in `vscode`.

See details about these tools on [vscode-go's documentation](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/blob/master/docs/tools.md).
