# learn-golang

My personal repo as I learn about `golang` along. 

## Installation

`.devcontainer` is included to host development environment in a Docker container and be used by `vscode`. See <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers> for more details

## go tools

`vscode` will install these tools automatically when you access a `golang` source code. 

TODO: consider to include these tools in the Docker image by default.
